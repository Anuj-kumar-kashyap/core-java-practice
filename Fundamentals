2. We cannot start any name with numeric digit. (Example: 1a, 4d, etc)

4. Length limit of characters. (In java we can give name as long we want but more than 15 character are not recommended)
5. We cant use name of reserved words.(which are 53 in java)
6. We can use the name of predefined classes and Identifiers.

Reserved words(53): further divided into 50 keywords & 3 constant literals.

50 keywords: 48 used keywords, 2 unused.
2 unused: goto & const
48 used keywords: Data types(8), Access modifiers(11), Control statements(11), Exception handling(6), Object related(4), Class related(6)
